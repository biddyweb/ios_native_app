API Details
===========

There is currently an API / development server which can be used for testing:

* [http://snowpool-development.herokuapp.com](http://snowpool-development.herokuapp.com)
is the api (also contains pretty up to date documentation)
* [http://devwebserver.snowpool.org.nz](http://devwebserver.snowpool.org.nz) is
  the desktop version

Those two endpoints use the same database.  You can sign up etc. all that
functionality should be working fine.

Like it?  Tell us how you're using it!
